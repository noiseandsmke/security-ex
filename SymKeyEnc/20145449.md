# Lab #11 - Encrypting large message
## 4.1. Encrypt and Decrypt Text file
1. Sine we have already installed OpenSSL, verify that by ```openssl version```:

2. Create text file named plain.txt with content below, this text represents information that needs protection in real-world applications.

3. Here we use the AES algorithm with a 256-bit key in ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode. ECB encrypts each data block independently, without using an IV (Initialization Vector). This makes ECB easy to implement but less secure compared to other modes.
```
openssl enc -aes-256-ecb -nosalt -in plain.txt -out ecb_encrypted.txt -K 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF
```

4. Check the encryption result. The encrypted data will appear as random, unreadable bytes, demonstrating the effectiveness of the encryption process.

5. The decryption process restores the original data from the ciphertext. This confirms the correctness of the encryption and decryption process, while also illustrating the reversibility of symmetric encryption.

6. Now, encrypt using AES-256-CBC. CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode requires an IV in addition to the key. CBC links data blocks during encryption, increasing security compared to ECB by hiding data patterns.

7. CBC decryption requires both the correct key and IV. This illustrates the importance of securely transmitting and storing both the key and IV in systems using CBC.

## 4.2. Comparing ECB and CBC Encryption Modes
1. Separate the header and body of the BMP file: BMP files have a structure consisting of a header (first 54 bytes) and data. We separate these parts to encrypt only the data portion, keeping the header intact. This ensures the file can still be opened after encryption.
```
dd if=origin.bmp of=header.bin bs=1 count=54
dd if=origin.bmp of=body.bin bs=1 skip=54
```

2. Now we encrypt the image data using both ECB and CBC to compare the effectiveness of these modes. ECB will encrypt identical blocks into identical encrypted blocks, while CBC will produce different encrypted blocks even if the original data is identical.
- For ECB: ```openssl enc -aes-256-ecb -nosalt -in body.bin -out ecb_encrypted_body.bin -K 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF```
- For CBC: ```openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -nosalt -in body.bin -out cbc_encrypted_body.bin -K 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF -iv 0102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F10```

3. Create encrypted BMP files: by combining the original header with the encrypted body, we create BMP files that can be opened. This allows for visual comparison of the encryption results of ECB and CBC.

```
cat header.bin ecb_encrypted_body.bin > ecb_encrypted.bmp
cat header.bin cbc_encrypted_body.bin > cbc_encrypted.bmp
```

4. When viewing the encrypted images, we'll notice that the ECB-encrypted image still reveals some characteristics of the original image, while the CBC-encrypted image is completely unrecognizable. This illustrates ECB's weakness in protecting data patterns and CBC's advantage in concealing information.

## Task 4.3. Impact of Bit Errors in Encrypted Text

1. Create a text file at least 64 bytes long.
- This long file ensures we have enough data to observe the error propagation effect in different encryption modes.
```
echo "This is a long text file that is at least 64 bytes long for encryption mode testing." > longtext.txt
```

![](https://github.com/noiseandsmke/security-ex/blob/main/SymKeyEnc/img/12.jpg)

2. Encrypt the file using AES-256 in different modes. We encrypt the same text using four different modes (ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB) to compare how they handle bit errors.
```
openssl enc -aes-256-ecb -nosalt -in longtext.txt -out ecb_encrypted.bin -K 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -nosalt -in longtext.txt -out cbc_encrypted.bin -K 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF -iv 0102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F10
openssl enc -aes-256-cfb -nosalt -in longtext.txt -out cfb_encrypted.bin -K 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF -iv 0102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F10
openssl enc -aes-256-ofb -nosalt -in longtext.txt -out ofb_encrypted.bin -K 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF -iv 0102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F10
```

3. Corrupt the 5th bit in each encrypted file.
- This step simulates transmission or storage errors by changing one bit in each encrypted file. This allows us to observe how each encryption mode handles errors.
```
printf '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01' | dd of=ecb_encrypted.bin bs=1 seek=4 count=1 conv=notrunc
printf '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01' | dd of=cbc_encrypted.bin bs=1 seek=4 count=1 conv=notrunc
printf '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01' | dd of=cfb_encrypted.bin bs=1 seek=4 count=1 conv=notrunc
printf '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01' | dd of=ofb_encrypted.bin bs=1 seek=4 count=1 conv=notrunc
```

4. Decrypt the corrupted files.
- This step allows us to observe the impact of bit errors on decrypted data in each mode.
```
openssl enc -d -aes-256-ecb -nosalt -in ecb_encrypted.bin -out ecb_decrypted.txt -K 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -nosalt -in cbc_encrypted.bin -out cbc_decrypted.txt -K 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF -iv 0102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F10
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cfb -nosalt -in cfb_encrypted.bin -out cfb_decrypted.txt -K 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF -iv 0102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F10
openssl enc -d -aes-256-ofb -nosalt -in ofb_encrypted.bin -out ofb_decrypted.txt -K 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF -iv 0102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F10
```

5. Compare the decrypted files with the original file and note the differences.

- When comparing the results, we'll notice:
    - In ECB, only one 16-byte block is affected.
    - In CBC, the corrupted block and all subsequent blocks are affected.
    - In CFB and OFB, the error only affects a number of bytes corresponding to the error position within the block.

- Conclusion:
    - ECB has the best error isolation but is the least secure in terms of confidentiality.
    - CBC provides better security but errors propagate to all blocks after the corrupted block.
    - CFB and OFB provide a balance between security and error resilience.
