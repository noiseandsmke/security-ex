# Task: Packet filter with iptables
## Part a: Setup rules on router to block all access into it except ping.
- Access the router container by running a command ```docker exec -it router bash ```.

- On the router container, first we need to flush existing rules by running ```iptables -F```. '-F' stands for 'flush', clearing all existing rules to start with a clean slate.

- Set default policies, by running these following commands:
    - '-P' sets the default policy.
    - INPUT DROP: blocks all incoming connections.
    - FORWARD ACCEPT: allows packet forwarding (necessary for router functionality).
    -   OUTPUT ACCEPT: allows all outgoing connections.
```
iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
```

- Allows packets that belong to established connections or are related to existing connections. This ensures that current connections are not interrupted and response packets can return. ```iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT```

- Allow ping: ```iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j ACCEPT```. This rule allows ICMP echo-request (ping) packets to enter the router. This fulfills the requirement of task a, permitting pings to the router.

-  Allows all traffic on the loopback interface (lo). This is necessary for many applications and services to function normally on the router.: ```iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT```

![](https://github.com/noiseandsmke/security-ex/blob/main/Firewall/img/a_06.jpg)

- Set FORWARD policy to ACCEPT:``` iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT```. While not an INPUT rule, setting the FORWARD policy to ACCEPT is necessary for the router to perform its packet forwarding function between networks. This ensures that the router can still route traffic between different subnets.

- Blocking HTTP/HTTPS: Port 80 is used for HTTP traffic, while port 443 is used for HTTPS. By dropping packets destined for these ports in the FORWARD chain, we are preventing HTTP and HTTPS traffic from passing through the router. The curl command typically uses these ports for web requests. By blocking these ports, we arw effectively preventing curl from successfully connecting to web servers through the router.
```
iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP
iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --dport 443 -j DROP
```

- Lists all current iptables rules for verification. The router's firewall is configured with the following key rules:  ```iptables -L -v -n```
    - INPUT chain:
        - Default policy: DROP (blocks all incoming traffic by default)
        - Allows established and related connections
        - Permits ICMP echo requests (ping)
        - Accepts all loopback traffic
        - Explicitly blocks TCP traffic on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS)
    - FORWARD chain:
        - Default policy: ACCEPT
        - Blocks TCP traffic on ports 80 and 443, preventing HTTP and HTTPS traffic from passing through the router
    - OUTPUT chain:
        - Default policy: ACCEPT (allows all outgoing traffic)
    - This configuration effectively blocks all access to the router except for ping, while also preventing HTTP and HTTPS traffic from being forwarded between network segments

- Successful ping from 'outside' to 'inside' and vice versa.

- Also check telnet in 'outsider' to 'inner' and it fail.

- Finally, also check curl in 'outsider' to 'inner' and it fail.

- So that we have done the task.

## Part b: Setup rules on router to prevent computers on subnet 10.9.0.0/24 from accessing the internal web server (iweb).
To preventing computers on the 10.9.0.0/24 subnet from accessing the internal web server (iweb) we need to set up a firewall rule on the router using iptables.
1. First, connect to the router container: ```docker exec -it router bash```

![](https://github.com/noiseandsmke/security-ex/blob/main/Firewall/img/a_14.jpg)

2. Then, add an iptables rule to block access from the 10.9.0.0/24 network to the internal web server (iweb with IP address 172.16.10.110): ```iptables -A FORWARD -s 10.9.0.0/24 -d 172.16.10.110 -j DROP```.
- -A FORWARD: Add the rule to the FORWARD chain
- -s 10.9.0.0/24: Specify the source as the 10.9.0.0/24 network
- -d 172.16.10.110: Specify the destination as the IP address of iweb
- -j DROP: The action is to drop the packet

![](https://github.com/noiseandsmke/security-ex/blob/main/Firewall/img/a_15.jpg)

3. Verify that the rule has been added: ```iptables -L FORWARD -v -n```

![](https://github.com/noiseandsmke/security-ex/blob/main/Firewall/img/a_16.jpg)

4. After implementing these steps, computers on the 10.9.0.0/24 network (including outsider and badsite) will be unable to access the internal web server (iweb) at 172.16.10.110. We can test this by attempting to curl from the outsider machine:

So that we have done this task!

## Part c: The badsite was found to contain malwares and source of delivering bots. Setup rules on router to stop computers on subnet 172.16.10.0/24 from accessing the badsite.
To set up rules on the router to prevent computers on subnet 172.16.10.0/24 from accessing the badsite:
1. First, connect to the router container via ```docker exec -it router bash``` as in task b.
2. Add an iptables rule to block access from the 172.16.10.0/24 network to the badsite (which has IP address 10.9.0.10): ```iptables -A FORWARD -s 172.16.10.0/24 -d 10.9.0.10 -j DROP```
- -A FORWARD: Add the rule to the FORWARD chain
- -s 172.16.10.0/24: Specify the source as the 172.16.10.0/24 network
- -d 10.9.0.10: Specify the destination as the IP address of the badsite
- -j DROP: The action is to drop the packet

![](https://github.com/noiseandsmke/security-ex/blob/main/Firewall/img/a_18.jpg)

3. Verify that the rule has been added: ```iptables -L FORWARD -v -n```

![](https://github.com/noiseandsmke/security-ex/blob/main/Firewall/img/a_19.jpg)

4. After implementing these steps, computers on the 172.16.10.0/24 network (including inner and iweb) will be unable to access the badsite at 10.9.0.10. We also can test this by attempting to curl from the inner machine:

So that we have done the task!
