# Task 1: Normal transaction with CRSF vulnerability
## 1.1: Login, check balance:
- Open the source folder in terminal
- Run the target.py file by: ```python target.py```
- All the port running on the local host with port 5000

![](running_target)

- Login user account through: http://[::]:5000/login

![](login_page)

- Enter username and password of the given user Alice:

![](login_alice)

- Login with alice account successfull

![](logged_alice)

- Checking balance of user alice through http://[::]:5000/balance

![](alice_balance)

## 1.2: Doing the transaction
- Go to http://[::]:5000/transfer to do the transaction

![](alice_transfer)

- Try transfer to user Bod 1000$ by enter:

![](alice_transfer_bob)

- Checking bob balance, whenever the transaction is success or not.

![](bob_balance)

- So that Bob's balance has increased by 1000$, when Bob already had 10.000$ in the account balance.

## 1.3: Transfer money illegitimately
- Change a little bit in 'hidden_form.html' for exploit run in the background successfully

![](hidden_form_change)

- Suppose now Bob is still logged in after the above transfer process. We started making illegal transfers by luring Bob into accessing and running hidden_form.
- First, we deploy the hidden form to the local area, by run ```python -m http.server 8000``` and chose hidden_form.html to run.

![](hidden_form_run)

- After running the hidden form, it will work in the background. The place where a money transfer transaction will be made without Bob's knowledge, because now Bob only sees a picture of a cat appearing on the screen.
- Let's check to see if this illegal transaction was successful or not by going to bob's blance.

![](bob_balance_hacked)

- Bob's amount was previously $11,000 but has now decreased to $10,000 after running the malicious code. Transferred that $1000 to the hacker's account.

- Checking the balance of the attacker's account, we can see that he has $1,000 that he just stole from Bob.
