# Task 1: Normal transaction with CRSF vulnerability
## 1.1: Login, check balance:
- Open the source folder in terminal
- Run the target.py file by: ```python target.py```
- All the port running on the local host with port 5000

- Login user account through: http://[::]:5000/login

- Enter username and password of the given user Alice:

- Login with alice account successfull

- Checking balance of user alice through http://[::]:5000/balance

## 1.2: Doing the transaction
- Go to http://[::]:5000/transfer to do the transaction

- Try transfer to user Bod 1000$ by enter:
  
![](https://github.com/noiseandsmke/security-ex/blob/main/CSRF/img/alice_transfer_bob.jpg)

- Checking bob balance, whenever the transaction is success or not.
  
![](https://github.com/noiseandsmke/security-ex/blob/main/CSRF/img/bob_balance.jpg)

- So that Bob's balance has increased by 1000$, when Bob already had 10.000$ in the account balance.
## 1.3: Transfer money illegitimately
- Change a little bit in 'hidden_form.html' for exploit run in the background successfully
  
![](https://github.com/noiseandsmke/security-ex/blob/main/CSRF/img/hidden_form_change.jpg)

- Suppose now Bob is still logged in after the above transfer process. We started making illegal transfers by luring Bob into accessing and running hidden_form.
- First, we deploy the hidden form to the local area, by run ```python -m http.server 8000``` and chose hidden_form.html to run.
  
![](https://github.com/noiseandsmke/security-ex/blob/main/CSRF/img/hidden_form_run.jpg)

- After running the hidden form, it will work in the background. The place where a money transfer transaction will be made without Bob's knowledge, because now Bob only sees a picture of a cat appearing on the screen.
- Let's check to see if this illegal transaction was successful or not by going to bob's blance.
  
![](https://github.com/noiseandsmke/security-ex/blob/main/CSRF/img/bob_balance_hacked.jpg)

- Bob's amount was previously $11,000 but has now decreased to $10,000 after running the malicious code. Transferred that $1000 to the hacker's account.
- Checking the balance of the attacker's account, we can see that he has $1,000 that just stole from Bob.

- That means every time the victim visits a malicious website, their account balance will be attacked by hackers and $1000 stolen.
# Task 2: CSRF Countermeasure implementation

## 2.1: Solution 1: Using CSRF token
- Import necessary modules:
    - Add from flask import session to imports ```from flask import session```
    - Import secrets module for generating secure tokens ``` import secrets```

![](https://github.com/noiseandsmke/security-ex/blob/main/CSRF/img/import.jpg)

- Set up a secret key for the Flask application:
    - Add ```app.secret_key = secrets.token_hex(16)``` after creating the Flask app

![](https://github.com/noiseandsmke/security-ex/blob/main/CSRF/img/secret_session_key.jpg)

- Modify the login route:
    - Generate a CSRF token when the user logs in
    - Store the token in the session ```session['csrf_token'] = secrets.token_hex(16)```

![](https://github.com/noiseandsmke/security-ex/blob/main/CSRF/img/login_generate_token.jpg)

- Modify the transfer route:
    - Check for the presence of the CSRF token in the form data
    - Validate that the submitted token matches the one in the session
    - If the tokens don't match or the token is missing, return an error

![](https://github.com/noiseandsmke/security-ex/blob/main/CSRF/img/transfer_check_token.jpg)

- Added warning function on hidden form to know whether CSRF attack has completed or not.

![](https://github.com/noiseandsmke/security-ex/blob/main/CSRF/img/hidden_form_update.jpg)

- Start the attack again like what have done in previous Task 1. After login to vitim account and check balance, run hidden_form to perform CSRF attack we recieve an alert:

![](https://github.com/noiseandsmke/security-ex/blob/main/CSRF/img/hidden_form_alert.jpg)

- Next we will check the victim account balance, there is nothing change in the amount of money. And also we recieve the 403 ERROR that is 'Invalid CSRF token'. So the task is done.

## 2.2: Solution 2:
